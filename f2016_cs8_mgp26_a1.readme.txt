Define variable for distance
Define variable for gas
Ask user if they are using usc or metric
If they are using metric...
Ask user what distance they traveled in km
Print "metric: distance = x km"
Convert this distance to miles
Print "usc: distance = x miles"
Ask user how much gas was used in liters
Print "metric: gas = x liters"
Convert amount of  gas to gallons
Print "usc: gas = x gallons"
Compute consumption by writing that it equals distance/gas
Print "metric: consumption = x 1/100km"
Convert consumption to mpg
Print "usc: consumption = x mpg"
Create an if-elif statement for gas consumption rating
