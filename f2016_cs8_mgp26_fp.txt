You have to use the same code and logic as the third assignment...
Ask the user to input the file name using a string
Use a dictionary in the form of a list in the output
Read lines in the output using readline
Open the file
Split the strings using line.rstrip('\n') to remove the unwanted ends of the strings
Add the output name and distance to the dictionary - name and distance are each keys
Define the data to be able to find the number of files and the number of lines in the file
as well as the total distance run and each individual distance
After this has been determined, create an empty dictionary
Inside put the name and distance to find the minimum and maximum distances run
print data found in the correct format


But this time add a class
Define the class
The class should include the name of the participant, how many times their name appears
in the input files and the total distance run
Use the __init__ function
define addDistance and set the correct distances (0 and 1)
Return the name, distance and number of runs
Use the __str__ function
Print data
