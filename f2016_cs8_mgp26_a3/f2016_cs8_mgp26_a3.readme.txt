This program is designed to read the master input list file and retrieve the names from each of the three files in them
individually
After it has done this, it should take out the names and distances
then figure out a number of different quantities
To do this I opened the master file and instructed the program to take out the names from each of the lists
In order to do so!
create a for loop that gets the distance and name from each list
After getting this information, the rest is just answering the questions that need to be answered
